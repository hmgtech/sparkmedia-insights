IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED

Efforts  governments  control wheat

says   survey  support prices     wheat
exporters  Argentina Australia Canada  EC   US
    In  countries  example Australia  Argentina
  highly dependent  wheat shipments  export
income  may  problems  reducing production
    A policy  cutting wheat production  lead 
unemployment  job prospects  agriculture limited
Alternative crops may offer inferior returns   
lead  lost export revenue  balance  payments problems
    The IWC outlines  courses  action open 
governments  wheat exporting countries
    They  continue  support prices   hope  
 world economy improves demand  wheat will rise 
surpluses wil  reduced  eliminated
    Alternatively support   limited  wheat 
  easily sold  needing   stored   long
period
    This option may prove     politically
unattractive   result   producers abandoning
wheat production  report 
    The third option    governments  distinguish
  commercial  social aspects  agriculture
possibly varying support prices according  farm size 
 production
    The IWC review covers support prices   major exporting
countries  1982 At  time   period  
producers cut support prices  response  growing surpluses
    These changes    result  lower export
subsidies    occasions currency fluctuations 
 offset lower prices   domestic currency
    For example  198586  198687  EC intervention

currency units Ecus It dollar terms  currency  
 export transactions  denominated  intervention

supporting farm prices  put  strain  national exchequers
  governments  now searching  ways  cut
expenditure  report says
    The proportion  world wheat output produced   
major exporters declined   period covered   survey
 40 pct  1982  35 pct  1987 This  partly due
